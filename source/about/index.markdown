Greetings, friend.

My name is Leonardo. I am a systems engineer currently based in Sydney,
Australia. If I had to describe what I do in two words I would say I am
a computer programmer (then I would probably complain about that absurd
two-word limit), but that is only because full-time procrastinator is still not
a recognised occupation.

I do love technology and my job involves a fair bit of programming. 

I started this blog in 2008 with the intention of documenting my interests and
the things I have learned, but then it had to be put aside when I hit a major
milestone in my lifelong quest for happiness: I migrated to this beautiful
continent, which in all honestly felt a little like simultaneously losing
a limb and learning to fly.

It did turn out well in the end, by the way, as I am today happier than I've
ever been. Recently becoming a parent may have had something to do with it.

Anyway,

[nowhere](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx)
I decided it would be nice to start blogging again and try to keep going for
a while. The cool thing is that it doesn't matter if actual humans ever read
what I have to say: I believe there is a lot of value in putting your thoughts
on metaphorical paper, with the added bonus of potentially helping out that
poor chap Webb C.  Rawler, who seems lost and keeps coming back to this site
all the time.

### So what should you expect?

The stereotypical nerdy stuff: gadgets, science and science fiction, video
games, programming and technology in general. As the title of the blog
suggests, I may also spend some time in musing about the impedance mismatch
between [the PEBCAK generator](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/PEBKAC.html)
and the [electronics living inside the beige box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_box). 

### The blogging stack

I am currently using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for blogging, so posts
are written in [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and converted to static html with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
The resulting static pages are published to both [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) (I'm
still undecided on which one is better but both satisfy my current
requirements). I learned about setting up a site on Heroku from Sam de Freyssinet's post on
[blogging With Octopress on Heroku](http://def.reyssi.net/blog/2012/01/14/get-blogging-with-octopress-on-heroku).

I write my posts using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) installed on
a [Raspbian-running](http://www.raspbian.org/) [Raspberry Pi Model B](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
(one of my favourite pieces of hardware, I must say). My dotfiles for Raspbian are based on
[Zach Holman's](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) and
can be found [here](https://github.com/dredix/dotfiles/branches/raspbian). It
goes without saying that I use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for version control.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to these projects, products and
platforms. You are truly awesome.

Other forms of touching are highly discouraged.
