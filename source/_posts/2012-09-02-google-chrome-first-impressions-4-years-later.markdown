Exactly 4 years ago, on 2 September 2008, Google released the first beta of their web browser: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/). I remember how difficult it was to download it that same day, with Google's servers probably brought to their knees, and then how I stopped at pretty much everyone's desk to <s>procrastinate</s> exchange impressions. I decided to keep it around for a while to see where it would go. Eventually I stopped using all the other browsers on a daily basis, and today it is the first software I install on any new computer (with the obvious exception of the operating system itself). This is what I thought back then:

> Just downloaded Chrome, a new browser by Google, and their latest step towards absolute Internet domination.

> First thing I notice after installing: It's fast. As in impossibly fast, especially when compared to Internet Explorer. Opening tabs is instantaneous: there is no weird delay between pressing the new tab button and that tab being ready to use.

> The vertical scrolling in my laptop's trackpad is broken: It only scrolls down. It does work however with the in-browser adobe PDF reader.

> Searching inside a page is simple, although somewhat limited. You can't specify case-sensitive searches, for instance.
 
> Importing from Firefox worked flawlessly.

> Zooming in has a devastating effect on page layout: Only the font size is incremented. I thought this was a solved problem on modern browsers. I hope they fix it soon.

> [Backpack](http://backpackit.com) has a weird alignment in the login page. Everything else is working as expected.

> I'm trying some random websites, and all of them are rendering fine: [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/), [Fake Plastic Rock](http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Alltop](http://alltop.com/), [Popurls](http://popurls.com/) and of course [Google itself](http://www.google.com).

> The address bar is not as fast as Firefox's awesome bar. It's not bad, though.

> Searches through the address bar use the Google site corresponding to my current location and I can't find a way to change it to google.com instead.

> In a perfect world, an archetypal web browser would exist and every single website would render perfectly in that browser. We don't live in a perfect world, though, and at least in these early stages I don't see Google Chrome being the one and only browser for every user and every possible situation. I'll keep an eye on it anyway to see where it goes.

Happy birthday, Google Chrome. You have done well.
